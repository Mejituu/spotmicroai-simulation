### Controls
Assuming you have a Logitech Gamepad F310:

`A`: switch between stepping and RPY

`X`: E-STOP (engage and disengage)

**Stepping Mode**:

* `Right Stick Up/Down`: Step Length
* `Right Stick Left/Right`: Lateral Fraction
* `Left Stick Up/Down`: Robot Height
* `Left Stick Left/Right`: Yaw Rate
* `Arrow Pad Up/Down` (DISCRETE): Step Height
* `Arrow Pad Left/Right` (DISCRETE): Step Depth
* `Bottom Right/Left Bumpers`: Step Velocity (modulate)
* `Top Right/Left Bumpers`: reset all to default

**Viewing Mode**:

* `Right Stick Up/Down`: Pitch
* `Right Stick Left/Right`: Roll
* `Left Stick Up/Down`: Robot Height
* `Left Stick Left/Right`: Yaw

Changing `Step Velocity` while moving forward:

Changing `Step Length` while moving forward:

Yaw In Place: Slightly push the `Right Stick` forward while pushing the `Left Stick` maximally in either direction:

### Reinforcement Learning

#### Drift Correction
I've found that the Bezier Curve gait lends itself well to optimization via RL. Notice that the open-loop forward command drifts significantly over time (rougly 1m per 2m forward):

![DRIFT](spot_bullet/media/spot_drift.gif)

With a one-dimensional action space [`Yaw Rate`], and a 16-dimensional observation space [`IMU Inputs` (8), `Leg Phases` (4), `Leg Contacts` (4)], an `Augmented Random Search` agent (linear) was able to correct the trajectory after 299 epochs:

![NODRIFT](spot_bullet/media/spot_no_drift.gif)

Here is the policy output for this demo. It's clearly biased on one end to account for Spot's drift:

#### Stability on Difficult Terrain
Another, more interesting RL challenge was to induce stability on randomized and programmatically generated rough terrain. For this challenge, a simple Proportional controller was employed to deliver yaw correction as would be the case if the robot were teleoperated or able to localize itself.For increased policy robustness, the terrain, link masses and foot frictions are randomized on each environment reset.

Here, the action space is 14-dimensional, consisting of `Clearance Height` (1), `Body Height` (1), and `Foot XYZ Residual` modulations (12). `Clearance Height` is treated through an exponential filter (`alpha = 0.7`), but all other actions are processed directly. These results were trained with only 149 epochs.

Before training, the robot falls almost immediately:

After training, the robot successfully navigates the terrain:

## How To Run

### Dependencies
* ROS Melodic
* Gazebo
* Pytorch
* Pybullet
* Gym
* OpenCV

### Control:
First, you're going to need a joystick (okay, not really, but it's more fun if you have one).

**Setting Up The Joystick:**
* Get Number (you will see something like jsX): `ls /dev/input/`
* Make available to ROS: `sudo chmod a+rw /dev/input/jsX`
* Make sure `<param name="dev" type="string" value="/dev/input/jsX"/>` matches your setup in the launchfile

Then simply: `roslaunch mini_ros spot_move.launch`

You can ignore this msg: `[ERROR] [1591631380.406690714]: Couldn't open joystick force feedback!` It just means your controller is missing some functionality, but this package doesn't use it.

**Non-Joystick Use**

If you don't have a joystick, go to `spot_bullet/src` and do `./env_tester.py`. A Pybullet sim will open up for you with the same controls you would have on the joystick, except each is on its own scrollbar.

**Using Different Terrain**

Navigate to `spotmicro/heightfield.py` and take a look at `useProgrammatic` and `useTerrainFromPNG` (you can play around with the mesh scales for each) to experiment with different terrains. Make sure that the `spotBezierEnv` instance has `height_field=True` in `env_tester.py` and `spot_pybullet_interface` depending on whether you're using the joystick/ROS version. The same goes for the RL environments. Note: these were adapted from the `pybullet` source code.

`useTerrainFromPNG`

`useProgrammatic`

![PROGT](spot_bullet/media/spot_prog_terrain.png)

With this terrain type, I programmed in a randomizer that triggers upon reset. This, along with the body randomizer from `Pybullet's Minitaur` increases your RL Policy's robustness.

#### Reinforcement Learning
Go to `spot_bullet/src` and do `./spot_ars_eval.py`. When prompted, enter `#POLICY_NUMBER` (for example, 149 for the rough terrain example).

Make sure you `git checkout spot_forward` for the most up-to-date RL environment which includes the body and terrain randomizer. Once this project is complete, I will merge this branch into `spot`, which is the main branch.
